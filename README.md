# Python Data Structures
<b>Data Structure:</b> Data Structure is the structural way of saving and arranging data. The Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) help to solve common problems while handling these datas. <br>
This repository focuses on help others learn about <i><a href=https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php>Data Strutures and Algorithms</i> more efficiently through analysing codes that are written in <i>Python</i>.
Short summarizations of every code is given here below,

## Recursion
Recursion is the process a function calls itself with same or different parameters 
to work similar to a loop and get an operation done.<br>
Every recursion has 3 important properties:
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, it runs the same operation multiple time with different parameter</li>
  <li>Secondly, in each recursive function call, the input parameter gets smaller and make the problem compact</li>
  <li>Lastly, each recursive functions must have a stopping condition. Otherwise, it will run infinitely.</li>
</ul>

## Array
An array is a linear data structure that is used to store and access multiple element in a linear way.
Many algorithms utilizes arrays to manage data. In python it can be compared with "list" data types.
Arrays are one of the most essential part to learn and code about data structures.

## Linked List
Linkes list a data structure that is used to make insertion and deletion operations more structured.
The differences between linked lists and arrays are,
<ul>
  <li> Linked list is non-contagious. Whereas, array is contagious.</li>
  <li> In case of linked list, memory is allocated to each elements individually. On the other hand, the whole array has a single allocated memory.</li>
  <li> Linked list is more efficient in instering and deleting a data than an arry.</li>
  <li> Linkes list follow a sequence to access data which array does not.</li>
</ul>
